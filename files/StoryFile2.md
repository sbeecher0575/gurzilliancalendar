{K} Quickly, a feigned sigh sang out
loud. My queen ally, Fay, sat
solomnly outside my lavatory. With
queenly artifice, Fay said, "such ornate

donned an aristocratic air.\p

{KT}    "Wait... I don't remember <s>co</s> this... Have
    I been here before?"\p

    My throat felt like sandpaper and I <s>wouldn't</s>
    my back ached. I couldn't remember the last
    time I drank something - <s>well</s> but then again
    <s>I</s> everything older than a few moments was lost
    in my mental fog.\p

    I looked around, seeking some sort of catalyst
    to set off my recollection. <s>I</s> Curtains, peeling
    paint - is that a stage over in the corner? I think
    so. Am I in a theatre? A concert hall? If I am,
    where is everyone else?\p

{K} This place seemed as familiar, that
my thirst drove me forward toward
a bend in the hallway and as i
rounded the corner I saw a wafer
fountain.\p
    Thirsting is        sweet sorrow.
                  such\p
    i lunged toward it aching for a ðŸ’§,
but as I pushed the PUSH
bar, my hands passed right
through and my momentum carried
me through the wall.\p

{T}<s>So</s> Incorporeal, then. <s>May</s> Perhaps that ought
to surprise me, but it didn't realy. But it
was infuriating to kmow that there was water
so close and yet so inaccessible. The fountain
taunted me within my grasp and yet beyond
my plane of existence.\p
    Suddenly, the sound of metal on wood. I
hadn't realized how oppressive the silence was
until it had been broken. Without memory, I had
to rely on instinct, and my instincts said to
beware the source of that sound.\p
{S} I became aware of my movement. <s>Rotating</s>
<s>slowly</s> Not just aware, but in control. The
sound of metal on wood, where have I seen
it? Heard it? Not like a hammer on boards,
but more of a scraping. I swam away from
the sound. I was in a tube. Rushing, <s>like</s>
like aa dinghy braving the crash of victoria falls,
I plunged deeper and spewed out into a
metal dish. The water fountain! I lapped
up its lavish nectar, the sweet tangy <s>umami</s> river
of tears replenishing my thirst.\p
{KT}    After I felt sufficiently quenched, I <s>~~~~~~</s>
felt the sense of purposlessness <s>~~~</s> creep up
on my mental horizon. To thirst, to let <s>desire</s> my
base instinct consume me - that is what it meant to
be truly alive. And with my gluttony I had satisfied
the urge - but at what cost?\p
    Dejected, I sat down when I realized I had
planted myself ontop a little dingy. Seeing no point
<s>I</s> staying, I set sail. The ocean beneath me,
the clouds above me, and a little snail that
had accidentally tagged along. For days we
drifted ; for days we were driven by ferocious
winds. I knew we would sail off the end of the
world one day. Maybe then we would be free.\p

{K} Oceans seen at a distance have
every <s>banshees</s> being's dreams within them.
For some they <s>hark of</s> herald riches, traded
from exotic shores. For some they
signal conquest, a path to lands yet
untamed. For some they only stand
apart from the shore that is known
and sit ever as a backdrom, to
the dull and uneventfull days
of the living that rush through
their fingers like torrential downpours
unable to be held.\p

    Now banshees, on the other
hand, <s>I</s> dream of all the things
we had and <s>rember</s> remember
what we have not yet done. {T}If
only we could remember what we have
already done. Maybe, then, it would be clear
where I should go.\p

    My thirst returned. Though it plagued me,
I reveled in its meaning. However sohrtsighted, I was
again with purpose. And yet, I faced a new
conundrum- to maintain or to fulfil? Could I
maintain a purpose without <s>trying to</s> endeavoring
to fulfil it? But if I fulfilled it, what then?\p

    Mercifully, my gloomy introspection was
interrupted by a shoreline up ahead.\p

nothing about them, an authority figure on their
life?\p

Anyway that's just me being annoyed with
work. We all know life would crumble

    I confess - Ive started
stamping only in time with
my own heartbeat. I've heard

shots with an exhale when
their body is at its stillest.\p

I think we are one with something bigger. Or,
at least, we are becoming. I can feel it when
we open our book. When we command
them to sign. When we stamp our seal
of Approval.\p

Something is at play here. Something larger
than me and my stamp.\p

Let's continue. These next couple are interesting.\p

Even my breathing feels impregnated with color.
why does this human form leave such chaos
behind it when it could leave order? Such
a petty thing to eat, to sleep, to breathe, to

NEWSTORY{K}Invasion of the JUMBY-snatchers!!!\p

{T}We knew it was only a matter of time. They've
been after our jumby for years. But I still can't
believe this is happening\p
    Ma said we <s>had</s> have to go into hiding. <s>W</s> As
much as I want to stay, I know she's right.
<s>James</s> Dieter is only four, and Angela not yet two. We
can't fight and protect them at once.\p
    Pa and Rudy left two days ago, to fight. We've
packed everything into the wagon, and we've done
our best to leave no trace of who was here.
They'll never stop until they get our jumby, but
we certainly won't be helping them.\p
{S} Most of the time, they never even see
us. We hide in tents, among trees, and
wagon place to place until then stop noticing
our presence. But they've started tracking
our patterns, studying us; they built "safeguards"
to prevent us from staying in one location
too long and all the while convinced everybody
else that we are the enemy.\p
    Pa decided it was too dangerous, with
Rudy , who has always been the best Scout
of us, went on what he called "a
secret reconnaissance mission" to cheer us up.\p
{KT}    He left earlier this morning. Tipped his
    hat and flashed that chipped-tooth
    grin that reminded us all how close
    we'd come to losing him and yet endeared
    him to us all the more. Oh, Rudy. Why
    do I feel like this was the last time I'll
    see you smile?\p
    Ma <s>Pa</s> was making soup (gazpacho, of
course - they can smell smoke, so we haven't
cooked since the early days). I was sitting,
placidly, staring out the <s>w</s> tent flap and
dreaming of seeing fireworks like I had
once as a little girl. All was peaceful.
Then Ma asked the seemingly innocent
question: "Where's Angela<s>"</s>?"\p
    The answer was, of course, the one
we all dreaded. In horror, Ma and I craned
our heads to the cieling. {K}"{KT}Angela<s>.</s>{K}; get over
here there's a cobweb we need
to clear." Ma said.\p
    We had found an unusual
strategy - we used baby strollers, swaddles,
and cribs to conceal our JUMBY.
In their contempt for the
young, they paid no mind to such
things. And so, when their
wet and faceted eyes
roamed this tattered earth, they
saw not the treasure that
was ours.\p
{T} I <s>carried</s> carry Angela on my back, and Ma <s>carried</s> carries
our jumby on hers, swaddled like a newborn
babe. Dieter just <s>did</s> does his best to keep up.\p
    We're heading into unknown territory now. I
think Ma suspects we're heading for a trap, like I
do, but it's still our best chance. If we stay put,
they'll find us. And any other direction, we'll be
heading straight for them.\p
    Dieter's been asking questions - which is normal
for his age, but these are dangerous ones. Why
do we need our jumby, why are they trying to
snatch it, how will Pa and Rudy ever find us
again. He's <s>so</s> too young for all of this.\p
{S} After all <s>on</s> of our mumbled responses
faded into the dust kicked up by Dieter's
shoes, he asked the most piercing question
of them all.\p
    Where are we going?
I glance at the wrinkles on Ma's weathered brow
and all she can say is "I don't know"\p
    The sun sets over what might have
been another beautiful evening from the mesh
window of our dilapidated tent, and a tear
from Ma's cheek <s>hits the</s> collides with a
cry from Angela in the air.\p
    "Come on, <s>children</s> kids. It's not the first
time they've tried to steal our JUMBY
and it certainly won't be the last. Whoever
out there you look to , they are mighty
proud"\p
{KT}    I managed a grimace, mostly for the young
'uns sake. Ma's speech cheered us to some
extent, but it only roused the deeper question
in me: who do I look to? There is nowhere
left to look. There is only the cracked and
barren world, devoid of jumby; and the long
and dusty road ahead. We're caught between
the tatters of our past and the fog of our future,
and I don't <s>remember what it's really like to thin</s> really
know what it <s>to</s> means to be present anymore.
But that doesn't matter. What matters is our jumby,
strapped to our bosoms, and our <s>family</s> journey.
I keep walking.\p

were different one day. They

    Jumby spoke:\p

    "We have seen all that we

along. Our hearts sank with
the realization and it's eyes
drank up our despair with greedy
thirst. <s>And with no</s> <s>As</s> The
other snatched jumbies had
surrounded us, and at once, they lunged.
