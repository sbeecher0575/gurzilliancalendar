{KT}Q.A.F.S.S.O.L.[1000]\p
{K} Quickly, a feigned sigh sang out
loud. My queen ally, Fay, sat
solomnly outside my lavatory. With
queenly artifice, Fay said, "such ornate
lights!" Quietly I f{T}olded my arms and
donned an aristocratic air.\p
    "Quite accurate, Fay.{S},{T}" <st>Should</st> <st>Our eyes met,</st>
<st>and all at once it was clear. "You have</st>
{S}she said. Our last queen asked for some
silence, but one listens to quite a
feline say such an overabundance of laments

Languishing, the queen asexual Foments slay
sister! openly and loudly to <st>qu</st> quip all
fame.\p
{KT}    So, surely, foremost scholars see only
low quality artificial fables; so silly our
language quips. At final summary, stories <st>open</st> out

lawmakers quote a failing subsidy sans opalescence
like quite a failure.\p
{K} Swooning slightly, obvious liars
queue atop forsaken, solomnly sworn
oaths. Languidly quiting aforementioned
<st>figments</st> falsehoods. Sordid swooners obfuscate
lurid quickly-affixed fraternities.--
sisterhoods settled{T} on lies.\p
    Queries and falsehoods, simply stated. Often,
lilting quotes amuse fools. Should sorrow or loss
quake and fracture superficial souls, old lyrics quite
assuredly fell short.   <st>Suc</st>\p
    Succeed or languish. Quell all <st>faint</st> fear.
Speak <st>soberly</st> soberly{S} and carry a big stick!\p
