{T}Planet 10: Attack of the <ul>Earthlings</ul>\p
[2000]{A}   It was a particularly shady day on Planet 10.
Every day was shady on Planet 10 because the
Star was really bright so they planted a lot of
upstanding trees to protect their skin from Starburns.
However, by this point in evolution,
it didn't really matter because all the inhabitants
of Planet 10 were mole people. {S}However,
there was one mole who wasn't like the rest of them.\p

    While it was too dangerous to venture too
far from any colony— Starburns were especially
lethal to the mole people— Janissary (Jane for
short) dreamed of one day finding out what
lie above the foliage.\p

    At night she would sneak out of her
hole and climb as high as she could into
the treetops, and watched what little she could
see of the sky above lazily drift by.
She only ever made it about 50-60 leaflings
high, but she felt like she was soaring.\p

{J}On one particular night, Jane felt a little more
daring than usual and was determined to reach the
top, wherever that was. She climbed and climbed and
climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed and
climbed and climbed until she could barely see
the ground. She knew it would take ages to get
back home, but she continued without any regard
for the danger or the ridicule of her peers.
One moment she was climbing and the next, not more
leaves stretched out above her. {T}She almost fell
from the treetop, so shocked was she with the
view above!\p
    Sure, she'd caught glimpses of pink through the
leaves, but here, the entire sky stretched before
her like a sea of flowers. Something soft and
white like the hut of her colony's chief
drifted across it.\p
    And the star! Oh, it almost hurt to look,
so bright was it! Jane had never seen
{A}anything quite like it.\p
    Though it went unnoticed at first, soon she
began to feel a tingle spreading across her skin.
It was a curious feeling — not painful, but
not pleasant either.\p
    Suddenly, Jane felt the tingle slam
into her mind like a ton of marks (that's mole
for bricks). Before she could react, she felt
herself being enveloped by a strange substance.
She tried to fight it, but her eyes closed.\p

* [2000]6 [3000]months [3000]later *\p

Jane emerged from her cocoon {S}covered
in a thick, effervescent goop. She had no
idea how long it had been. It felt like
she was just there, soaring above the treetops,
but it could have been days, [2000]months!\p
    She reached out and felt a cool, metallic
wall to her left. As best she could, Jane
wiped the strange liquid from her eyes and
peered out.\p
    A hexagonal room, with large chairs in
a circle surrounding what seemed to be a large pot.
On closer inspection it was smoking.\p
    The chairs were at least ten times
her height, and matched the size of everything
else in the room.   [3000]Enormous.\p
    When Jane stood, a{J}n alarm sounded from
somewhere in the room making a sharp chirping
sound. Jane quickly extricated herself from the
remains of the cocoon and stepped toward
the smoking pot.\p
    Before she could catch a glimpse of its
contents, a section of the wall opened and
a dozen creatures entered.\p
    {T}Suddenly the giant furniture made sense! These
creatures must be at least ten farthings
tall! As the runt of ehr colony, Jane was
used to feeling small, but not like this!\p
    Most of the creatures sat themselves in the
chairs around the room's perimeter. One, who
wore a shiny clear shield over its eyes, crouched
near Jane.\p
    It opened its mouth and<1500>...</> Jane supposed it was
speaking, but she'd never heard anything like it{A}.\p
    The sound it was emitting were thin & high-pitched—
at odds with its enormous size. She shrank back,
unsure of how to interact. After a few moments,
the creature retreated & returned with a platter
of small, fragrant-smelling items. {S} (chicken nuggest)\p
    "Janissary, you've really done it this time."
She whispered to herself.\p
    she picked up\p
the warm, pillow-sized sac and surveyed it.
The smell was not bad, but in the situation
she thought it best to express caution after
the rash decisions she's made today,\p
    "or however long it's been."\p
    Jane was alone in the room now, and she
hobbled in making noises she found more
palatable. Sitting down in front of Jane,
this mini giant stared and pointed with
its giant eyes and moist complexion.
It reached down and pushed Jane off of
the warm pillow.\p
    {J}Before she could even feel indignant,
the large (small?) creatured snatched
up the pillow and ate it. Janissary felt a little
silly, but pried off a reasonable piece of the
strange food and tasted it. Immediately finding
it not to her liking, Jane swallowed and pushed
the dish back toward the creature. It obviously
enjoyed them{T}, it could have it.\p
    The creature happily munched on its food,
paying no mind to Jane. Suddenly, a thought
occured to her — if this thing could get in, then
she could probably get out!\p
    She stood and took a few steps. The little
giant ignored her. Trading its ambivalence as a
sign she was free to go, she hurried to
the doorway and peeked around it.
    A hallway. No giants, countless doorways.
Jane ran, looking through each door,
Lots of furniture. A few giants. No exits

    {S}It was always her eyes. And that smile.\p

    <200>That damned smile.</>\p

    [2000]:/\p

    The moment I saw "Streep" on the
    nametag I knew I was in love.\p

    Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.
    Let's start at the beginning.\p

    It was a typical morning, I arose,
    brushed my teeth, and then went to
    sleep. Because the night time is when
    the fun begins. Little did I know that
    I was about to make the biggest mistake
    of my life.\p

    I put on my jumpsuit, donned my mask, and
{J}walked down the street to the monorail. Life was more
fun in the city, but who could afford those prices? I'm
content to like cheap and make my way into the city when
it's time to party.\p

The monorail itself was built to be the cheapest transportation
around. I quickly stepped inside
when the doors opened, cramming into the assembled
crowd of passengers. {T}There's every kind of person here —
stern businessmen, ladies of the night, frazzled mothers
and their rambunctious children. But most of us are
headed to some rave or another.\p
    {A}Just thinking about it sends a rush down my
spine. If I close my eyes I can almost
hear the beat, smell the sweat, & feel the crush
of dancing bodies pushe against mine. But
with the honk of a horn the moment
has passed, & I have to rush
through the doors to make sure I don't miss
my stop.\p
    Normally I'd head to the District, but
tonight I have something special in mind. {S}I
looked back through the open doors into the
now vacant cab, and with a flourish I stepped
back inside. Today I'm going to the
End of the Line.\p
    Out the window I watched the city lights
fade to steel beams, forgotten plywood, and the
red glow of the wildest mosh pit the
country had ever seen.\p
    As I approached, the beat grew louder
and filled my body with titillating euphoria.\p
    Then I was violently jerked back into reality
as an unbearably loud crunch of bending metal filled my
ears and the monorail slammed to a stop, breaking
free from the track and turning over. The car was
emptier now and I had to hold on to the ceiling
to avoid being bounced around too much. As it was, I
hit my head pretty hard in the commotion.\p
    {T}My ears buzzed, and the monorail
seemed to sway like a ship at sea. But I could
still see the red glow of the End of the Line and
I could hear the music thrum through my soul. I
had to get there!\p
    I climbed out of the cab, followed by a few
other partygoers. Even though I was dizzy. I
stumbled toward the mosh pit. No concussion was
going to stop me from having the night of
my life!\p
    {A}Like a snake in the night, I perservered.
In the very moment I was about to collapse,
I waas buoyed up by the pulsing crowd. I had
made it! I closed my eyes, let my limbs loose,
& let the atmosphere fold me in.\p
    It could have been minutes, it could have
been hours, but I was shocked into
awareness at the same time as everyone else:[2000]
the power outage.\p
    {S}The music stopped. In my dazed
state I almost didn't feel the drop,
or rather the lack of one. Because
when I opened my eyes, I was no longer
hovering. I was in her arms. I looked
around. Drums discarded, broken wood pieces
and metal strings, and the rush of air
as she carried me out of the collapsing
room. There was no red light anymore. In
the starlight, I could only make out one
word.   [3000]Streep.\p
    She put me down, her nametag glinting,
and I groaned. Head split, bones aching, just
another night out with the <st>guys!</st>{A}gals!\p

    {J}At this point, you could probably use some background
information about me. This story could only make
sense to those who know me and I want to avoid
any potential misunderstanding.\p
    My name is {T}Darryl. I've only ever been with
one woman— my wife, Serena. But on our
honeymoon, she drowned and I swore I'd never fall
in love again. I've been going to parties every night
to fill the void she left in my heart.\p
    But as I lay there, looking up at her, something
filled my empty heart. Her eyes. And that
smile. That damned smile.\p

    :)\p

    "Name's... Darryl." I groaned. It was hard to
talk through the pain, but I'd do anything
to see that smile.\p

{A}->Until now. Funny thing about love for the average woman—
it can be completely vanquished by one look from
Meryl Streep. Old wife? I literally forgot her name.
Meryl is an Oscar machine, & if I can get even
a single slice of that sweet, Academy pie, I'll
be riding high for the rest of my life.
