{T}Planet 10: Attack of the <ul>Earthlings</ul>\p
[2000]{A}   It was a particularly shady day on Planet 10.
Every day was shady on Planet 10 because the
Star was really bright so they planted a lot of
upstanding trees to protect their skin from Starburns.
However, by this point in evolution,
it didn't really matter because all the inhabitants
of Planet 10 were mole people. {S}However,
there was one mole who wasn't like the rest of them.\p

    While it was too dangerous to venture too
far from any colony— Starburns were especially
lethal to the mole people— Janissary (Jane for
short) dreamed of one day finding out what
lie above the foliage.\p

    At night she would sneak out of her
hole and climb as high as she could into
the treetops, and watched what little she could
see of the sky above lazily drift by.
She only ever made it about 50-60 leaflings
high, but she felt like she was soaring.\p

{J}On one particular night, Jane felt a little more
daring than usual and was determined to reach the
top, wherever that was. She climbed and climbed and
climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed and
climbed and climbed until she could barely see
the ground. She knew it would take ages to get
back home, but she continued without any regard
for the danger or the ridicule of her peers.
One moment she was climbing and the next, not more
leaves stretched out above her. {T}She almost fell
from the treetop, so shocked was she with the
view above!\p
    Sure, she'd caught glimpses of pink through the
leaves, but here, the entire sky stretched before
her like a sea of flowers. Something soft and
white like the hut of her colony's chief
drifted across it.\p
    And the star! Oh, it almost hurt to look,
so bright was it! Jane had never seen
{A}anything quite like it.\p
    Though it went unnoticed at first, soon she
began to feel a tingle spreading across her skin.
It was a curious feeling — not painful, but
not pleasant either.\p
    Suddenly, Jane felt the tingle slam
into her mind like a ton of marks (that's mole
for bricks). Before she could react, she felt
herself being enveloped by a strange substance.
She tried to fight it, but her eyes closed.\p

* [2000]6 [3000]months [3000]later *\p

Jane emerged from her cocoon {S}covered
in a thick, effervescent goop. She had no
idea how long it had been. It felt like
she was just there, soaring above the treetops,
but it could have been days, [2000]months!\p
    She reached out and felt a cool, metallic
wall to her left. As best she could, Jane
wiped the strange liquid from her eyes and
peered out.\p
    A hexagonal room, with large chairs in
a circle surrounding what seemed to be a large pot.
On closer inspection it was smoking.\p
    The chairs were at least ten times
her height, and matched the size of everything
else in the room.   [3000]Enormous.\p
    When Jane stood, a{J}n alarm sounded from
somewhere in the room making a sharp chirping
sound. Jane quickly extricated herself from the
remains of the cocoon and stepped toward
the smoking pot.\p
    Before she could catch a glimpse of its
contents, a section of the wall opened and
a dozen creatures entered.\p
    {T}Suddenly the giant furniture made sense! These
creatures must be at least ten farthings
tall! As the runt of ehr colony, Jane was
used to feeling small, but not like this!\p
    Most of the creatures sat themselves in the
chairs around the room's perimeter. One, who
wore a shiny clear shield over its eyes, crouched
near Jane.\p
    It opened its mouth and<1500>...</> Jane supposed it was
speaking, but she'd never heard anything like it{A}.\p
    The sound it was emitting were thin & high-pitched—
at odds with its enormous size. She shrank back,
unsure of how to interact. After a few moments,
the creature retreated & returned with a platter
of small, fragrant-smelling items. {S} (chicken nuggest)\p
    "Janissary, you've really done it this time."
She whispered to herself.\p
    she picked up\p
the warm, pillow-sized sac and surveyed it.
The smell was not bad, but in the situation
she thought it best to express caution after
the rash decisions she's made today,\p
    "or however long it's been."\p
    Jane was alone in the room now, and she
hobbled in making noises she found more
palatable. Sitting down in front of Jane,
this mini giant stared and pointed with
its giant eyes and moist complexion.
It reached down and pushed Jane off of
the warm pillow.\p
    {J}Before she could even feel indignant,
the large (small?) creatured snatched
up the pillow and ate it. Janissary felt a little
silly, but pried off a reasonable piece of the
strange food and tasted it. Immediately finding
it not to her liking, Jane swallowed and pushed
the dish back toward the creature. It obviously
enjoyed them{T}, it could have it.\p
    The creature happily munched on its food,
paying no mind to Jane. Suddenly, a thought
occured to her — if this thing could get in, then
she could probably get out!\p
    She stood and took a few steps. The little
giant ignored her. Trading its ambivalence as a
sign she was free to go, she hurried to
the doorway and peeked around it.
    A hallway. No giants, countless doorways.
Jane ran, looking through each door,
Lots of furniture. A few giants. No exits

    {S}It was always her eyes. And that smile.\p

    <200>That damned smile.</>\p

    [2000]:/\p

    The moment I saw "Streep" on the
    nametag I knew I was in love.\p

    Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.
    Let's start at the beginning.\p

    It was a typical morning, I arose,
    brushed my teeth, and then went to
    sleep. Because the night time is when
    the fun begins. Little did I know that
    I was about to make the biggest mistake
    of my life.\p

    I put on my jumpsuit, donned my mask, and
{J}walked down the street to the monorail. Life was more
fun in the city, but who could afford those prices? I'm
content to like cheap and make my way into the city when
it's time to party.\p

The monorail itself was built to be the cheapest transportation
around. I quickly stepped inside
when the doors opened, cramming into the assembled
crowd of passengers. {T}There's every kind of person here —
stern businessmen, ladies of the night, frazzled mothers
and their rambunctious children. But most of us are
headed to some rave or another.\p
    {A}Just thinking about it sends a rush down my
spine. If I close my eyes I can almost
hear the beat, smell the sweat, & feel the crush
of dancing bodies pushe against mine. But
with the honk of a horn the moment
has passed, & I have to rush
through the doors to make sure I don't miss
my stop.\p
    Normally I'd head to the District, but
tonight I have something special in mind. {S}I
looked back through the open doors into the
now vacant cab, and with a flourish I stepped
back inside. Today I'm going to the
End of the Line.\p
    Out the window I watched the city lights
fade to steel beams, forgotten plywood, and the
red glow of the wildest mosh pit the
country had ever seen.\p
    As I approached, the beat grew louder
and filled my body with titillating euphoria.\p
    Then I was violently jerked back into reality
as an unbearably loud crunch of bending metal filled my
ears and the monorail slammed to a stop, breaking
free from the track and turning over. The car was
emptier now and I had to hold on to the ceiling
to avoid being bounced around too much. As it was, I
hit my head pretty hard in the commotion.\p
    {T}My ears buzzed, and the monorail
seemed to sway like a ship at sea. But I could
still see the red glow of the End of the Line and
I could hear the music thrum through my soul. I
had to get there!\p
    I climbed out of the cab, followed by a few
other partygoers. Even though I was dizzy. I
stumbled toward the mosh pit. No concussion was
going to stop me from having the night of
my life!\p
    {A}Like a snake in the night, I perservered.
In the very moment I was about to collapse,
I waas buoyed up by the pulsing crowd. I had
made it! I closed my eyes, let my limbs loose,
& let the atmosphere fold me in.\p
    It could have been minutes, it could have
been hours, but I was shocked into
awareness at the same time as everyone else:[2000]
the power outage.\p
    {S}The music stopped. In my dazed
state I almost didn't feel the drop,
or rather the lack of one. Because
when I opened my eyes, I was no longer
hovering. I was in her arms. I looked
around. Drums discarded, broken wood pieces
and metal strings, and the rush of air
as she carried me out of the collapsing
room. There was no red light anymore. In
the starlight, I could only make out one
word.   [3000]Streep.\p
    She put me down, her nametag glinting,
and I groaned. Head split, bones aching, just
another night out with the <st>guys!</st>{A}gals!\p

    {J}At this point, you could probably use some background
information about me. This story could only make
sense to those who know me and I want to avoid
any potential misunderstanding.\p
    My name is {T}Darryl. I've only ever been with
one woman— my wife, Serena. But on our
honeymoon, she drowned and I swore I'd never fall
in love again. I've been going to parties every night
to fill the void she left in my heart.\p
    But as I lay there, looking up at her, something
filled my empty heart. Her eyes. And that
smile. That damned smile.\p

    :)\p

    "Name's... Darryl." I groaned. It was hard to
talk through the pain, but I'd do anything
to see that smile.\p

{A}->Until now. Funny thing about love for the average woman—
it can be completely vanquished by one look from
Meryl Streep. Old wife? I literally forgot her name.
Meryl is an Oscar machine, & if I can get even
a single slice of that sweet, Academy pie, I'll
be riding high for the rest of my life.
NEWSTORY{J}<250>The Key Factory</>[1000]\p
    {T}Click. Whir<100>rrr...</> thump! Click. Whir<100>rrr...</> thump!\p
    It was all she'd hear for the next nine hours.
Footsteps in the background, the\p
walkie talkies of the Supervisors and even the National
Reports coming through her earpiece would be
drowned out by Click. Whirrrr... thump!\p
    {A}While the monotony bothered some,
Khrysanthemum took a sort of comfort from
the routine. What she lacked in
ambition & creativity, she more than made up
for in consistency, which made her well-suited
for her job.\p
    {S}She didn't dream of much, content with
the ever-present click-whirrrr-thump! of the machines.
There was always solace in routine. Sometimes during
a lull in the creation she'd hear the Supervisors
chastising another worker or the National Reports
listing names, "Evergreen.... Peonee...." Khrysanthemum never knew
any of them. So she didn't think much about
the names; it was just part of the routine.\p
    {J}She often wondered if other workers were different.
Did they know any names? The factory stretched on
endlessly, there must be hundreds of workers. Were they
all like her? Sometimes she struggled to imagine any other
life than the droning machines and clicking metal.\p
    {T}The National Reports said there was safety
in anonymity. The nation knew each citizen, and
each citizen knew the nation! The nation
cared for each citizen, providing work, shelter, and
daily rations. The National Reports said it was
safest to be satisfied with what the nation gives
and not to go looking for more.\p
    Click. Whirrrrr... thump! Thinking about such things too long
made Khrysanthemum confused. It was much
more calming to focus on her work.\p
    {A}Before she knew it, the day was done. She
followed the rest of her shiftmembers out, knocking
shoulders with those on their way in to pick
up what had been left off.
By the time she had made it to her apartment,
the sun had nearly disappeared
behind the skyline.\p
    {S}On her walk out the next morning, in the
space between the waste receptacles, in a place
she never noticed before, she saw a little
figure huddled, reaching out for her. She
recoiled quickly and marched away, afraid to
Err.\p
    "I<150>... </>am<150>... </><100>Evergreen...</>"\p
    Khrysanthemum froze.\p
    The raspy voice continued.\p
    "Help<150>.... </>me<150>....</>"\p
    Khrysanthemum turned around.\p
    "The<150>... </>keys<150>.....</>"\p
    This was not in the routine. The Supervisors
laid no protocol for such an issue, so she
turned and walked into the Click, Whirrrrr... Thump!
once more, But the entire day, she would not
stop thinking about the huddled figure.\p
    {J}About eight hours later, she heard one of the supervisors
call out her name. She almost missed it, they never
spoke to her. She was so suprised, she did miss everything
that followed, forcing the man to repeat his instructions.
"Report to senior office 5"\p
    {T}"Oh, uh, yes sir, right away, sir." Khrysanthemum stuttered.
It felt so wrong to leaev her station, but the Supervisor
clearly expected it of her, so she went.\p
    Each step down the long hallway increased her
trepidation. Past the maintenance rooms, custodial
closets, and junior offices, she reached office 5.\p
    Khrysanthemum knocked twice on the solid grey door
and waited for what felt like minutes. Just
as she raised her trembling fist to knock
again, the door burst open.\p
    {A}"Alright, the time has begun" said a tall, bespectacled
man. Khrysanthemum started, unsure of how to
proceed.\p
    "Come in, come in", the man said. "We
have a task for you".\p
<1000>.   .   .</>\p
    Khrysanthemum peered into the hole, struggling
to make room for her eye & the beam to penetrate
the small opening at the same time.\p
    "It's in here?" she asked, still skeptical.\p
    "Yes. You're not the first we've asked to retrieve
it, but we're hopeful you could be the last".\p
    {S}She wondered if this has anything to do with
the figure she saw earlier that day, or night.
Khrysanthemum never knew anymore.\p
    Prodding around with the thin metal rod,
she flipped, moved, and turned items in the
box. At last, she saw it, the glint of
metal on the ring. Pushing the rod through
it, she carefully balanced the key on the
rod as she tried to remove it from the box.\p
    Millimeters from the edge,
the key slipped off the rod, with the
loudest clang she would hear for some time.\p
    "Oh, Khrysanthemum, I really thought
you were going to be the one."\p
    {J}"I'm sorry sir," she said, "I'll try again"
"No, I'm afraid that won't be possible. We expect
only perfection, we require it. The guard will see you out."\p

The large man by the door grabbed her arm and
began dragging her away. She was too shocked
to resist. How could she leave the factory?
What would she do? What else could she do?\p
NEWSTORY{S}<400>The Messenger </><1000>II
    Into the Wild\p
{J}Gerald was a news man. He didn't deliver letters
or packages, he didn't deliver groceries. Gerald
was a news man. He was quite satisfied by that.
There was a certain nobility in it, knowing that, without
him, everyone would be completely disconnected. Nobody
lived close enough to anyone else to survive without the
delivery {T}of weekly news.\p
    He'd been a news man for nearly fourteen years
now. Ever since order had been reestablished and
the need for news addressed. He started each
week at the Hub, where he gathered the week's
news. Laws passed, updates on the war,
and, most important of all, storm predictions.
    {A}Once he had everything he needed, he'd strap
on his helmet (safety first), hop on his one-wheel,
and jet off down the block so fast it felt like
he was flying. Children would stop and stare in
awe, but knew not to get in his way. The
news stops for no one! Once he reached District
1, he'd come scraping to a stop & unfold
his megaphone. Hand on hip, mic in hand,
dapper as all hell & knew it too.\p
    Then, he'd close his eyes.\p
    {S}To the Orbiters, it probably looked like nothing
was happening. It was more of a thrumming, a
connection than message delivery. Once he closed
his eyes, the district froze. The streets were pulsing
with his message; Gerald did not communicate through
words but rather with a feeling— the people were
not told the weather but knew instinctively the
temperature, whether it was going to rain, and the
safe places to hide.\p
{J}Some said that men like Gerald would be replaced
one day, but he payed them no mind. He was a
news man and that would never change.\p

    When he returned to the Hub, he checked his
route and stared for a moment in surprise. Houses were
generally quite sparse, but the new location on his
map was farther out than he'd ever been. No
matter, he was a news man. He delivered the news. {T}He'd
deliver it wherever it was needed.\p
    Off he went to District 1, then 3, then 2
(for despite their names, this was the most
efficient route). He delivered the news
clearly, concisely, and accurately. As any good
news man would.\p
    Then it was time for this new location. He'd
stop in 5, 4, 6, and 7 on the way back.
Curious, not having had a new location in some
years, he jetted down the road. On and on he
went. Until he reached the end of the road,
and still, he was not in range of this new
location.\p
    {A}He mapped his brow with his monogrammed
sweat rag, took a shot of Gatorade, & was
off once again. Trees faded to bushes which
soon disappeared. An hour had passed
& he still wasn't there! An interesting development.\p
    A newsman though he was, he wasn't immune
to fatigue. He took a moment to meditate,
& after channeling the strength of 1000 boars,
the tenacity of 1000 lions & the speed of
1000 leopards, he continued his journey.\p
    {S}Gerald crested the hill, and saw nothing,
just the heat waves emanating off of the
green meadow. As he used up the last of the
leopard power, he was nearing 10,000 miles per
hour on his one-wheel. He noticed something
shimmering, in the distance,
but before he could react, the knights
had him surrounded.\p
    In a dizzying feat of acrobatics, they
circled him, and then descended.\p
    "THROUGH SNOW OR SLEET OR HAIL
    OR SHIT" he screamed trying to
fend them off.\p
    {J}Though his lion hearted tenacity had long
since turned to exhaustion, he was still determined,
and he still had Gatorade. A quick sip gave him
all the energy he needed to break through the
circle of knights and continue forward. He was
here to deliver the news, not have adventures of
his own.\p
    His destination wasn't far ahead and, as he
slowed, Gerald prepared his tools and kept watch
for more trouble. {T}He could just see the knights
on the horizon, but he was in range now. He'd
finish his delivery before they arrived. Once he was
done... well, he'd figure it out when it happened.
    "Through snow or sleet or hail or shit," he muttered,
and he closed his eyes.\p
    If his delivery was somewhat faster than usual,
no one could blame him. But he'd be damned if
he left anything out.\p
    News delivered, he opened his eyes, immediately
turning to locate the knights.\p
    They were too close now, and there were
too many to fight off. Maybe if he had the
strength of 10,000 boars and the tenacity of
10,000 lions, but {A}as it stood, 1000 leopards would
have to do.\p
    Shucking his one-wheel into his backpack, he bent
forward at the waist and stuck his arms straight
out behind him. One deep breath in— & he was off.\p
    In regular circumstances, he might have made it,
but these knights were far from regular. In fact, they
were
    — The 1990 Olympic gymnastics gold medalist
    — The entire Canadian curling team
    — Simone Biles
    — The rest of the American gymnastics team who
        aren't Simone Biles
so in reality, he never stood a chance. {S}Nevertheless,
he needed to try.\p
    Looking around him, he knew he would never
physically make it to his destination. So he'd deliver
from here.\p
    With a gleam in his eye, he pulled out the
megaphone from his pack and began the
broadcast.\p
    The knights froze. Gerald read them
the news: the joys and sorrows, the esciting, the
mundane, and the whirlwind that was about to
strike.
